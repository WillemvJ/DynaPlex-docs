DynaPlex 2 is a Python library for solving Markov Decision Problems and similar models (POMDP, HMM). It supports 
deep reinforcement learning, approximate dynamic programming, classical parameterized policies, and exact methods based on policy and value iteration. Models in DynaPlex 2 are written in Python, and exposed via a generic and vectorized interface. 

DynaPlex 2 focuses on solving problems arising in Operations Management: Supply Chain, Transportation and Logistics, Manufacturing, etc. 

.. note::

    If you are new to MDPs, you might benefit from first reading the :doc:`introduction to MDPs <getting_started/introduction_to_mdp>` and going through the step-by-step tutorial, starting with the :doc:`MDP formulation <tutorial/airplane_mdp>` pages.
